\section{Understanding the code} % (fold)
\label{sec:understanding_the_code}
Now that we detailed the model and how and why we built it so,
it seems a good idea to give some insight on how we obtained
the result from next section.

\paragraph{Filling in the transition matrices} % (fold)
\label{par:filling_the_transition_matrices}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Filling in the transition matrices}
As explained from a mathematical point of a view 
in~\ref{sub:modeling_using_markov_chains}, we need to fill in the
\emph{transition matrices} that will represent the probabilities
of going from one state to another throughout the board.
Firstly the method \lstinline|fillMatrixWithDiceProb| first fills the matrix
with the basic dice sum probabilities (see file \lstinline|board_proba.py|).
% (e.g. from state $i$ there is a
% $1/36$ probability to go to state $i+2$, $2/36$ to state $i+3$ and so
% forth).
Next we continue filling in the matrices by taking into account
the \emph{Chance} and \emph{Community chest} cards which both have
some cards redirecting to some other fields (i.e. \emph{Chance} 10
out of 17 cards and \emph{Community chest} 2 out of 17).
This is done in \lstinline|fillMatrixWithActionCommunityCardsProb|.
Finally, we take into account the strategies \emph{fine} and \emph{double throw},
respectively in the methods \lstinline|fillMFineWithJailProb|
and \lstinline|fillMDoubleThrowJailProb|.

\paragraph{Getting the stationary probabilities} % (fold)
\label{par:getting_the_stationary_probabilities}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Getting the stationary probabilities}
Once the transition matrix is filled up, we can easily
get the stationary probabilities, which we need to know
which fields are worth \enquote{betting on}.
Instead of solving it using the classical formula $\pi P = \pi$,
or iterating through a few step using a starting vector $\pi_0$,
we decided it was more efficient and simple to do it using the 
\lstinline|markovChain| class of the \lstinline|discreteMarkovChain| module.
We then get the stationary probabilities in the form of a vector
with our method \lstinline|calculateStationaryVector|.
To get the above mentioned function running we need a package.
For that, run in command line (or use \lstinline|pip3| depending on your system)
\begin{center}
  \lstinline|pip install discreteMarkovChain|
\end{center}

\paragraph{Computing the number of turns to equalize cost and rent} % (fold)
\label{par:computing_the_number_of_turns_to_equalize_cost_and_rent}
Using the stationary probabilities found previously and two \texttt{.txt}
files containing the costs of the different fields (with and without hotels),
we are able to get a vector containing the cost and 
rent prices of those fields in \lstinline|createVectorForCostAndRentOfFieldsSimple|.
The next step is then to count the number of turns needed for each fields
to equalize the cost and rent. This is done in \lstinline|calculateTurnsNeededForAllFieldsSimple|.
The two equivalent methods used for the hotels part have the same
name except \lstinline|Simple| is replaced by \lstinline|Hotels|.

\paragraph{Writing data to \texttt{.csv} files} % (fold)
\label{par:writing_data_to_csv_files}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Writing data to \texttt{.csv} files}
One will note the presence of a \lstinline|writeDataToCsvFile|
method. It make it possible to write the data from the stationary probability
vectors into two \texttt{.csv} files and later it enables us to use those
files with \LaTeX to get the tables presented in the \emph{result} section~\ref{sec:results}.

\paragraph{Simulating} % (fold)
\label{par:simulating}
One can have a look at the \texttt{main} method
in the file \lstinline|simulation.py| to enjoy various useful simulations
(single methods are explained in comments).
