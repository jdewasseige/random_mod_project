\subsection{Stationnary probabilites} % (fold)
\label{sub:stationnary_probabilites}

The stationary probabilities are obtained using
the \lstinline|discreteMarkovChain| package and
the results for both strategies are shown in
tables~\ref{tab:statio_double} and~\ref{tab:statio_fine}.

\subsection{Most lucrative streets to buy} % (fold)
\label{sub:most_lucrative_streets_to_buy}

Whenever we play \monopoly~we have to ask us at one point whether we want to buy or not a certain street 
that we landed on. Those who have played \monopoly~quite often know that there is that common sense that 
says: ``Buy the orange streets - They are the best!'' 
and ``Never buy the electricity or water factory - They are not any good''. 
Meant by the orange streets are the three streets on the spots 16,18 and 19. The electricity and water 
factories are the spots 12 and 28 respectively.

To start with, we briefly want to explain how you can buy streets, what you can do with it and how you can 
make money with it. Whenever a player lands on a \emph{street}, which is either a \emph{a colored street}, 
\emph{a train station} or \emph{a factory} that is not bought yet by another player, he can buy the street 
from the bank for a certain amount of money that we define at this point as the  \textbf{buying cost}.
Once the street is bought, the owner of the street earns money whenever another player lands on that street. 
This rent is defined as the \emph{Simple rent}. 
Once a player owns all colors of a \emph{a type of colored street} or all \emph{train stations} or all 
\emph{factories}, he will earn more than the \textbf{simple rent}. When owning all colors of a \emph{a type 
of colored street}, the player has the ability to built houses for a certain price to increase the rent other 
players need to pay when landing on the street. He can built up to 5 houses (= 1 hotel) per colored street 
for a cost that we define at this point the \textbf{cost for a hotel} and will get the \textbf{hotel rent}.
On \emph{train stations} and \emph{factories} we are not allowed to built any houses so the best possible 
rent is the rent one earns when owning all of them. For the sake of simplicity, we will call the cost of 
buying all streets also the \textbf{cost for a hotel} and the resulting rent also the \textbf{hotel rent}.

Now, we want to try to proof or contradict the statements written above by \emph{calculating the average 
amount of turns one player has to wait until the cost of having bought the street pays off by the rent he 
gets} which we define as the \textbf{number of turns to equalize rent and cost}. For this we will use the stationnary probability per field, the cost and the rent. Again, the rule 
that a player can throw the dice again if he throws a double is neglected for this analysis, so that we get 
the following formula to calculate the number of turns with $\pi_{stat}$ being the stationnary distribution.
\[
\text{Turns} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\pi_{stat} \times \text{Rent}}
\]
We will consider two scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cost = buying cost and rent = simple rent
	\item Cost = cost for a hotel and rent = hotel rent
\end{itemize}

Let's start we our first scenario. We calculate number of turns to equalize rent and cost \ref{figure1} 
and then we order this table in ascending order showing the ``best'' field on top. 
Certain field have a value of infinity because they are not up for sale. We included these fields for 
reasons of readability and they are naturally not included in \ref{figure2}.

\todo{@John: Here should be the two figures for the first scenario you get the data as explained in the 
video. Can you do the same thing you did for the stationnary probability?}

Looking at spot number 15, we can see that in order to equalize the cost of this train station, a player 
has to wait on average until the dice has thrown 298 times by other players.
We can see directly that the best streets are the factories, whereas the orange streets are not remarkably 
better than other streets. Does that mean that the common sense for \monopoly~is completely wrong?
Let's have a look at our second scenario.

\todo{@John: Here should be the two figures for the second scenario you get the data as explained in the 
video. Can you do the same thing you did for the stationnary probability?}

Now we see what we expected to see. The best streets are the orange streets and the factories are the worst 
fields. In this scenario it is also remarkable how much less turns are needed to equalize the cost for 
hotels on colored streets in comparison to the turns needed to equalize the cost for buying factories. And 
how much less turns in general are needed to equalize the costs in comparison to the first scenario.

What can we conclude? 
It is obvious that players are never paying off the cost of buying a street in the beginning without 
building hotels. It just takes too much time (ca. 300 turns) and the rent is too small. However, once the 
players have built hotels the rent gets much more important since it is paying off directly (ca. 28 turns). 
So a first result is that the hotel rent is ``10 times better'' than the simple rent.
Having the first result in mind, we also conclude that the order of the order of the ``best streets'' in 
the second scenario is the order a player has to look at when buying a street and thus, we can confirm 
the ``common sense'' of \monopoly~players.
