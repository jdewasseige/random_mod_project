\subsection{The board game} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_board_game}
The board game \monopoly~exists since the Great Depression and has
since been so popular that it has been translated into more than 37
languages and is the best-selling board game in the world.
The original idea was \enquote{\textit{to demonstrate that an economy which
rewards wealth creation is better than one in which monopolists work
under few constraints[1] and to promote the economic theories of Henry
George and in particular his ideas about taxation}}~\cite{wiki:monopoly}.

\subsection{Hypothesis and simplifications} % (fold)
\label{sub:hypothesis_and_simplifications}
For the sake of this project, we are going to use a simplified
version of \monopoly. Those simplifications will be described throughout
this section as well as the justification of why they won't affect
the result in a significant way.

\paragraph{Removing moving twice forward with doubles} % (fold)
\label{par:removing_special_rules_with_doubles}
The normal rules state that when a player throws a double, he can throw
it again, with a maximum of two consecutive doubles, otherwise leading
to jail.
One will note that the rule stating that one can get out of jail
by trying to make a double is not removed.

\paragraph{Simplifying jail outcomes} % (fold)
\label{par:simplifying jail}
While modeling the Markov process, it quickly appeared that the \jail~field
may cause some issues as some other factors may lead to going there (chance
and community chests cards) and getting out also leaves 3 possibilities.
Indeed the player can~\cite[p.18]{mit_course_notes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item stay there for three turns,
  \emph{  
  \item try to have a double and get out if one,
  }
  \emph{
   \item pay a 50 euros fine, or
  }
  \item use a \enquote{Get Out of Jail Free} card.
\end{enumerate}
Intuitively, the first strategy seems to be the best one to play once a lot
of buildings are around the game but the 3rd one seems best at the beginning
since it is essential to quickly get some streets.

The fact that four different strategies exist and that they are time related
adds a lot of complexity and we therefore decided to make the assumption that
only two choices are available for the player,
those being the \emph{second} and the \emph{third}.

\subsection{Modeling the \emph{board} using Markov chains} % (fold)
\label{sub:modeling_using_markov_chains}
As seen in class, a Markovian process is an appropriate way of representing a process
that has no memory and where the probability of being in a state at time $n$
only depends on our state at time $n-1$.
In this case, it becomes quickly clear that one \emph{time unit} represents one dice throw
per player (one would normally say one turn but
we assumed in section~\ref{sub:hypothesis_and_simplifications} that no
re throw was allowed).
The game will thus be represented using 40 states $(X_n)_{0\leq n\leq39}$,
each state being one the fields.
We immediately see that using this model combines perfectly with the game rules,
as only the previous throw can influence the next one.

By setting the \go~field to be state 0, we have the following \emph{transition matrix}
\[
  P = \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{00} & p_{01} & \dots \\
    p_{10} & p_{11} &  \\
    \vdots      &  & \ddots
  \end{pmatrix}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first and main influence for the transition probabilities
  is the \emph{dice sum} (see table~\ref{tab:dice_sum_prob})
  as it accounts for a majority of the fields.
  \item Next, one can take into account the chance and community chest
  fields as some of them implies changing your current location.
  \item Finally, we need to consider two other special squares :
  the Jail and GoToJail. Once on the latter there is a probability
  of one to immediately go to Jail.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
        \textbf{Dice Sum} & \textbf{Probability} \\
        \hline \hline
        2, 12 & 1/36 \\
        \hline
        3, 11 & 2/36 \\
        \hline
        4, 10 & 3/36 \\
        \hline
        5, 9 & 4/36 \\
        \hline
        6, 8 & $5/36$ \\
        \hline
        7 & 6/36 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Probability distribution of a two dice sum.}
  \label{tab:dice_sum_prob}
\end{table}

\todo{Explain somewhere that since the transition probabilities does not depend on
time, that the Markov chain is irreducible and positive recurrent,
all states are guaranteed to have a finite hitting time and thus
stationary probabilities exist.}

% \textbf{Defining a richness matrix}
% At this point we need to think about how we will manage the changing
% banks account of each player. 
% Ideas:
% - a matrix telling what each field is worth
% - simulating many games using stationary probas
